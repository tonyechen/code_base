        <p>This is a paragraph. I am just writing gibberish so that there is something to 
            read on the webpage and not just plank spaces in the paragraph. <b>We can also
            bold things like this</b>. <i>This is pretty cool. </i>
        </p>

        <br>
        <hr>
        
        <p>Use < br > to switch to a new line and < hr > to add a line. Also,
        <em> < em > emphasize stuff </em> </p>
